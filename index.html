        <p>Started watching the new <em><b>Fallout</b></em> series from Amazon and so far it's pretty damn good. So good that it got me playing <em><b>Fallout 4</b></em> again, which as I play again I honestly ekeep closing it out. Maybe I just like the story of Fallout but kind of just lose interest because of the gameplay. </p>
        <p>One thing that I believe that is making me come to terms of just liking the story of Fallout, is probably the fact that <b>Bethesda</b> (the company responsible for the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series), tends to release games that have a TON of bugs at the beginning of their life and it's getting annoying. I solely blame their fans for letting them get away with releasing unfinished projects. Hopefully Elder Scrolls VI isn't like that.</p>
        <p>I believe as a collective, we shouldn't allow these "super-rich" creators publish work that is mediocre at launch, especially if they have the funding to not do so. GO AHEAD! Push back your release date and stop saying you have a better version of what you put out already on it's way you money hungry little pig. LOOKING AT YOU SNYDER.</p>
